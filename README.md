# Mwginator
The repository for the 16 bit redstone computer I made

# How to use:
## 1: Installing the repo and its dependencies

First make sure you have Git installed so you can download this repo.
To do that, go to git-scm.com and download the version for your OS and install it.

Then you also need to install NodeJS and Python so go do that too.

Then clone this repo to your machine and launch a command line in the same directory as the cloned repo and run the command `pip install mcschematic`

Then also run `npm install` after that other command.

## 2: Get the computer in the world

Firstly, you need a mod that works with .schematic files, I use WorldEdit
This computer and its schematics were made for Minecraft 1.18.2 (the version the MCHPRS uses)

### How to get the computer in a non MCHPRS world

Now copy the file Mwginator.schem and blankRom.schem into the schematics folder in the installation you are using (by default its .minecraft)
Once you have that done paste the schematic in the world.

To run programmes, just transfer the .schematic file into the schematics folder of your installation,
then go to

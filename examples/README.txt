This is the examples folder which contains example programme schematics and the asm used to generate them.
The schematics have the .schem extension. I use WorldEdit to paste them in, you might be able to use other mods
but i dont know, but WorldEdit works on the MCHPRS though the commands are a bit different that normal.
The .txt files are the asm code I made, I then used the assembler to generate a schematic, but I included
the "source code" so you can modify them yourself.
